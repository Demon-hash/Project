# Web Shop
The website was made using the React library. The goal of the project is to gain experience working with different and current web technologies in 2023

The repository is not a monorep, there is only a separation into client and server parts

The server side is made using GraphQL to optimize the returned data, in my opinion this is exactly what web shops need, because there can be a lot of information about a product or anything else, while we only need 1 field out of all

In addition, it is planned in advance that there is the possibility of changing the theme and language

There is a separate README for the client and server parts, which shows the convention for naming files / directories as well as code style
